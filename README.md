Website for Aeromodelling club: https://notagoodnaina-github-893ny5ihk-notagoodnaina.vercel.app/
I have used React, Java Bootstrap, CSS and HTML for this project. 
Just two weeks ago I was completely unfamiliar with Bootstrap and React and had no idea how to procees. To create this website I started by cloning a sample React website from GitHub and slowly experimented by changing some features. As I became more well versed with Bootstrap my confidence increased and I changed some core components of the website like package.json files so that it could be hosted on Vercel and accessed easily. However some features like the darkened carousel buttons are missing in the Vercel website and can only be accessed by downloading the website and using npm start or likewise. 
Since I've only used Bootstrap for positioing the website is exteremly responsive and the images scale well in multiple screens. The website consists of a Navbar which can go to different tabs for different requirements. The main features are the Events and Airbots tabs. The viewport feature makes sure the images don't change scale or "squish/stretch" when the browser size is changed.
